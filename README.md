# From-Reviews-to-Insights-Analyzing-6M-Yelp-Records-for-Philly-s-Best-Restaurants

📌 Project Overview

As part of our Enterprise Data Management  course, our team built a 360° data pipeline to analyze the Yelp public dataset (6M+ records). The objective was to identify top-performing restaurants in Philadelphia by combining data engineering (Azure SQL) with exploratory analytics (Python).

We designed a relational schema in Azure SQL Server, loaded and filtered the dataset via SQL queries, and then used Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for in-depth analysis. The project demonstrated how structured pipelines can turn messy, real-world data into business-relevant insights.

📝 Concise Narrative Summary

Our team extracted and cleaned millions of Yelp reviews and business records, structured them into Azure SQL tables, and queried them to focus on Philadelphia restaurants. We applied filters (≥4.0 stars and 100+ reviews) for quality assurance, then pulled results into Python for deeper analysis. Using Pandas and visualization libraries, we uncovered customer sentiment trends, cuisine popularity, and restaurant rankings.

This workflow simulated a real-world data engineering → analytics pipeline, showing how SQL and Python can complement each other to deliver insights for both consumers (finding high-quality dining options) and restaurant owners (benchmarking performance).

📝 Engagement & Review Patterns

Philadelphia had ~666K reviews, one of the most active cities in the dataset.

Restaurants with <50 reviews often had inflated 5.0 ratings; those with >200 reviews stabilized at 4.2–4.4 stars.

Elite Yelp users contributed ~15% of reviews, averaging 2× more “useful” votes.

Negative reviews were ~30% longer than positive ones.

Seasonal spikes appeared in Nov–Dec, especially for family dining and fine dining cuisines.

🛠️ Tools & Methods

Data Source: Yelp Kaggle dataset (~6M+ records)
